    <h1>A Little About Me :)</h1>
    <p>
      Hello everyone! My name is Samanta Singh, I was born and raised in Reggio
      Emilia, Italy. I moved to Canada back in 2015 and I hate it here!
      Ethnically, I am Punjabi, you most probably have heard of us Punjabis, we
      are kind of everywhere. I am a full-time college student working at Amazon
      Logistics Station. I'm also a full-time, overworked, cook and comedian of
      my family! I am the only daughter so you know how that goes... I have an
      older <b>AND</b> younger brother, but no, I do not receive the
      <i>"princess"</i> treatment. I graduated high school a year ago and
      decided to take a year off to work and save up some money for my spending
      issues. The atual reason for taking a year off was to heal from the three
      years of high school truma I had to go through. Now that I made it to
      college, I am hoping for it to last longer than 3 years just to avoid the
      adult era. Terrifying. Whislt having such a busy life being awesome, I
      manage to get some free time away from life. I have plenty of hobbies or
      just activities I like to do.
